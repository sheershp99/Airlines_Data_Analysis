# Airlines Data Analysis
The following Data Analysis project has been created using SQLite database downloaded from ***Kaggle***. The database file ***travel.sqlite*** consists of 8 tables with total of ***35 columns*** and more than ***2.2M rows***. This database consists airlines data like information about aircrafts that a particular airline uses, informations about airports that these aircrafts fly to & from, boarding passes, bookings, flights, seats, ticket flights and tickets. 

The analysis of the data provides an insights about bookings made, occupancy in each aircraft type, total revenue generated over the period, and number of bookings vs the class. Using these insights, a conclusion is drawn and summarized at the end of the report.

### Python Libraries Used:
- **Sqlite3**: This library is used in this data analysis project to read the data from sqlite database.
- **Pandas**: This library is used for creation and manipulation of the dataframes.
- **Matplotlib**: This library is used for plotting charts & graphs for pictorial representation of the data to easily draw meaningful insights rather than looking at the entire data.
